Abbreviation key

Abbreviation short forms and long forms are identified using the
Schwartz and Hearst algorithm in

A Simple Algorithm for Identifying Abbreviation Definitions in
Biomedical Text
A.S. Schwartz, M.A. Hearst; Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing
8:451-462(2003)
 
The Schwartz and Hearst code (@author Ariel Schwartz, @version 03/12/03)
has been updated to work with the BioC classes: 
	- given a BioC passage or BioC sentence, the FindAbbr.java
	class calls a slightly modified ExtractAbbrev method to find
	all abbreviation definitions in the given text and their
	corresponding offsets.
	
	the output is written back in BioC XML format, where the
	original BioC passage or BioC sentence is enriched with new
	annotations and relations that express the abbreviations:
	annotations: long form and short form, relation: the link
	between long form and corresponding short form


    collection:  10 random PubMed documents with ASCII text
                 Original source ascii.xml

    source:  PubMed

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date documents downloaded from PubMed

    document:  Title and possibly abstract from a PubMed reference

    id:  PubMed id

    passage:  Either title or abstract

    infon["type"]:  "title" or "abstract"

    offset: The original Unicode byte offsets were not updated after
            the ASCII conversion.

            PubMed is extracted from an XML file, so literal offsets
            would not be useful. Title has an offset of zero, while
            the abstract is assumed to begin after the title and one
            space. These offsets at least sequence the abstract after
            the title.

    annotation:  Abbreviations

    id:  sequential integers from 0 prefixed by either 'SF' or 'LF'

    infon["ABBR"]:  "ShortForm" or "LongForm"

    location:  offset: A document offset to where the annotated text
                       begins in the sentence. Sum of the sentence
                       offset and the local offset within the
                       sentence.

               length: The length of the token.

    text:  Original text of the short form or long form.

    relation:  Long form / short form pair

    id:  sequential integers from 0 prefixed by 'R'

    node:  
             role: "ShortForm" or "LongForm"

             refid:  id of the sf or lf annotation as appropriate
