Here, we  report that Aip1p also interacts with the ubiquitous actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. A two-hybrid-based  approach using cofilin and actin mutants identified residues necessary for the interaction of actin, cofilin, and  Aip1p in an apparent ternary complex. Deletion of the  AIP1 gene is lethal in combination with cofilin mutants  or act1-159, an actin mutation that slows the rate of actin filament disassembly in vivo. Aip1p localizes to cortical actin patches in yeast cells, and this localization is  disrupted by specific actin and cofilin mutations. Further, Aip1p is required to restrict cofilin localization to  cortical patches. Finally, biochemical analyses show that  Aip1p causes net depolymerization of actin filaments  only in the presence of cofilin and that cofilin enhances  binding of Aip1p to actin filaments. We conclude that  Aip1p is a cofilin-associated protein that enhances the  filament disassembly activity of cofilin and restricts cofilin localization to cortical actin patches.</text><annotation

key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1233</offset><text>The actin cytoskeleton plays diverse roles in the cell,  mediating such processes as endocytosis, exocytosis,  cell motility, cell polarity, and cytokinesis in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. Each of these  processes requires the regulation of specific dynamic properties and spatial organization of actin filaments by a subset of a large collection of actin-binding proteins. To determine how actin and associated proteins function together  to control morphogenetic events, it will be important to  determine how actin-associated proteins are sorted to different structures of the cytoskeleton, and how the combined actions of different actin-associated proteins affect  cytoskeleton dynamics in these different structures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1973</offset><text>Saccharomyces cerevisiae presents excellent opportunities for the study of combined effects of actin-associated  proteins on actin assembly and organization both in vivo  and in vitro. The actin cytoskeleton of S. cerevisiae is organized into polarized cortical patches and cytoplasmic bundles of actin filaments aligned along the mother-daughter  cell axis (Adams and Pringle, 1984; Amberg, 1998). Little  is known about how actin-binding proteins are sorted between different compartments of the cytoskeleton, or  whether they themselves are responsible for forming these  specialized actin networks.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2578</offset><text>We previously described a two-hybrid approach for  characterizing interactions of actin-binding proteins with  yeast actin (Amberg et al., 1995a). We used this system  to identify yeast actin-associated proteins and examined  their ability to interact with 35 clustered-charged-to-alanine mutants of actin. Those mutations that disrupt the  binding of a particular ligand can identify regions of the  actin surface important for a given interaction and can delineate an interaction footprint when displayed on the  structure of actin. Actin interacting protein 1 (Aip1p),1  identified in our two-hybrid analysis using actin as bait,  had a very distinct interaction footprint on actin subdomains III and IV. We report here that in addition to interacting with actin, Aip1p also associates with the small actin-binding protein cofilin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3415</offset><text>Members of the cofilin/actin depolymerizing factor family are conserved actin monomer and filament binding  proteins that induce actin filament disassembly (for review  see Moon and Drubin, 1995). Yeast cofilin is 40% identical in sequence to mammalian cofilin/actin depolymerizing  factor; the gene is essential in yeast and the gene product  localizes to cortical actin patches (Moon et al. 1993). Recently, two advances have led to a greater understanding  of cofilin function in yeast: (1) A synoptic set of cofilin mutants was constructed by alanine scanning mutagenesis  (Lappalainen and Drubin, 1997) and (2) the structure of  yeast cofilin was determined (Federov at al. 1997).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4101</offset><text>In this report, we have used this large set of genetic and  structural tools in conjunction with classical biochemical  and cell biological analyses to gain insight into the function of the interactions between Aip1p, cofilin, and actin.

The failure of Aip1p  to localize in this strain is not due to a loss in the ability of  cofilin to bind to actin (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, Aip1p localization to cortical patches in an act1-112 strain is severely  compromised (Fig. 5 C), whereas cofilin localization to  patches in this strain is not affected (Fig. 5 D). Aip1p was  well localized to cortical patches in act1-119, act1-132,  act1-124, and act1-125 strains (data not shown) indicating  that Aip1p mislocalization is not caused by generalized defects in the actin cytoskeleton.

Although a small proportion (5-10%) of  purified Aip1p sedimented in the absence of actin in these  assays, this amount did not perceptibly increase upon addition of actin (data not shown). Given the two-hybrid interaction of Aip1p and cofilin, it seemed possible that an  actin-Aip1p interaction might be mediated by cofilin. To  test this hypothesis, we performed the cosedimentation assay in the presence of recombinant cofilin, which binds to  F-actin and accelerates disassembly rates (increasing subunit turnover), but does not significantly change actin  polymer levels at steady state (Fig. 7 B, lanes 1 and 2).  Strikingly, in the presence of both Aip1p and cofilin, we  observed a dramatic shift of actin and cofilin from the pellet to the supernatant (Fig. 7 A, lane 2). This shift might be  explained by invoking a monomer sequestering model as  applies for twinfilin (Goode et al., 1998), a protein that  binds stoichiometrically to actin monomer, preventing nucleotide exchange and polymerization. We examined the  effects of stoichiometry on the Aip1p-dependent shift by  varying the concentration of Aip1p (0.012-2.5 muM; Fig. 7  A, lanes 2-6) or cofilin (0.12-2.5 muM; Fig. 7 B, lanes 3-7)  in cosedimentation assays with constant concentrations of  F-actin (2.5 muM).

To establish the dependence of this binding on cofilin, we pelleted increasing concentrations of actin filaments with or without stoichiometric cofilin with in vitro- translated Aip1p. Aip1p cosedimented with the F-actin in  the absence of added cofilin, but addition of 1:1 cofilin increased the amount that cosedimented (Fig. 8 A). The  binding of Aip1p to cofilin-F-actin is saturatable with a Kd  of ~4 muM. Similar results were obtained by Western blot  analysis of identical experiments with purified Aip1p (data  not shown). We next examined how much added cofilin  was required to get the increased binding. The amount of  Aip1p cosedimenting with 7.5 muM F-actin falls off linearly  with cofilin concentration (Fig. 8 B). Aip1p cosedimentation with F-actin could be increased in the presence of cofilin either because cofilin creates more binding sites for  Aip1p, or because cofilin increases the affinity of Aip1p  for actin. To distinguish between these possibilities, we  added 15 and 45 nM purified Aip1p to 5 muM cofilin-saturated actin filaments (which is below the concentration  that saturates Aip1p binding) and ran the sedimentation  reaction. A threefold higher concentration of Aip1p increases the fraction of Aip1p cosedimenting with actin,  suggesting that Aip1p binding sites are not saturated, and  that the cofilin-dependent increase in binding reflects an  increased affinity of Aip1p for F-actin in the presence of  cofilin (data not shown). To determine stoichiometries  of these proteins in yeast cells, we estimated the ratio  of Aip1p/cofilin/actin in the cell by comparing immunoblots of whole-cell extracts and purified proteins of known  concentration (data not shown). Aip1p, cofilin, and actin  are each present in whole-cell extracts at a ratio of about  1:1:5 or 1:1:10. </text><annotation id="E19"><infon key="type">ExperimentalMethod</infon><location offset="34782" length="169"/><text>We used radiolabeled in vitro-translated Aip1p to evaluate binding to F-actin at a low concentration of Aip1p,  which would not promote net disassembly of the filaments.</text></annotation></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>37016</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>37027</offset><text>Aip1p-Cofilin-Actin Interactions Suggest a Ternary Complex</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37090</offset><text>Aip1p was originally identified by its two-hybrid interaction with actin (Amberg et al., 1995a). Further two-hybrid  analysis revealed an interaction between Aip1p and cofilin  (Fig. 2) raising the possibility that actin, Aip1p, and cofilin  might form a ternary complex. The existence of such a ternary complex is supported by evidence that Aip1p and cofilin are dependent on each other and on actin for their  correct localization in vivo (Fig. 5). Binding experiments  with purified proteins also support an Aip1p-cofilin-actin  complex (Fig. 8). Binding of purified or in vitro-translated  Aip1p to F-actin is concentration-dependent and increases  at high ratios of cofilin/actin. Since cofilin is a contaminant  in yeast actin preparations, despite efforts to deplete it  (~1 muM/100 muM actin), we cannot rule out the possibility  that contaminating native cofilin is responsible for the  baseline binding to F-actin in the absence of added recombinant cofilin. Thus, it is possible that Aip1p binding to  F-actin is strictly cofilin-dependent. We were unable to  show a direct interaction between Aip1p and cofilin and/ or G-actin by native gel shift or by cosedimentation with  GST-Aip1p, further suggesting that Aip1p interacts  with cofilin on F-actin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38364</offset><text>A large set of mutations in both actin (Wertman et al.,  1992) and cofilin (Lappalainen et al., 1997) was used in  conjunction with the two-hybrid system to identify regions  of actin and cofilin involved in the Aip1p interaction (Fig.  3). Those data that describe the cofilin-actin interface appear sound since they agree with similar studies using biochemical (Lappalainen et al., 1997), modeling (Wriggers  et al., 1998), and structural (Amy McGough, personal  communication) approaches. The binding footprint (as obtained by two-hybrid analysis) for Aip1p on the surface of  actin (Fig. 3 B, blue and red) partially overlaps with the  cofilin binding site (red). Similarly, the footprints of Aip1p  and actin on cofilin overlap as four cofilin mutants were  specifically defective for both Aip1p and actin binding.  Though overlapping interaction interfaces are consistent  with both competitive interactions and a ternary complex,  we favor the latter model because it is consistent with the  localization and in vitro binding data discussed above.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>39421</offset><text>While most of our structural data can be incorporated  into a coherent model for interaction in a ternary complex,  there were several discrepancies between the biochemical  and two-hybrid data. First, only by two-hybrid assay was  cof1-9 defective for binding to actin. Additionally, although cof1-6 has a wild-type growth phenotype, by two-hybrid analysis it appears to be completely defective for  actin binding. This interaction has not been tested biochemically. These discrepancies may be an artifact resulting from the fusion to Gal4p in the two-hybrid system. Alternatively, the cofilin-actin two-hybrid interaction might  be subtly different than that observed in vitro with purified components. Note that cof1-19 is the only cofilin mutant that is defective for Aip1p localization, but it appears  to interact well with both Aip1p and actin by two-hybrid  analysis. This cofilin mutant may interact well with actin  and Aip1p in the two-hybrid complex but have subtly altered binding properties in vivo.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>40435</offset><text>In Vivo Interactions Support a Role for Aip1p in  Promoting Actin Dynamics</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40510</offset><text>Though the AIP1 deletion mutant has no obvious phenotype on its own, allele-specific synthetic lethality was observed between aip1Delta and act1-159, cof1-4, cof1-5, cof1-22,  and cof1-6 (at 37 C). These results suggest that in the double mutants, a common function is compromised enough  that cell viability is lost. Because act1-159, cof1-5, and  cof1-22 have all been shown to decrease the rate of F-actin  disassembly in vivo (Lappalainen and Drubin, 1997;  Belmont and Drubin, 1998), we postulate that Aip1p  also promotes actin filament turnover. This conclusion is  supported by our biochemical studies of Aip1p that demonstrate that it causes cofilin-dependent actin filament disassembly (Fig. 7). Note that Cof1-22p has defects in actin  binding in vitro, but that Cof1-5p does not (Lappalainen et  al., 1997), suggesting that the synthetic interaction is not  simply a function of compromised actin binding by cofilin.  The cofilin-actin interaction has not been tested biochemically for cof1-4 or for cof1-6.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41530</offset><text>Specific sorting of cofilin to cortical patches but not cytoplasmic cables is lost in aip1Delta (Fig. 6 C) and cof1-19  (Fig. 6 E) strains. One model that could explain these results in terms of the in vitro effects of Aip1p on actin filaments assumes that two populations of actin cables, one  cofilin-bound and one tropomyosin-bound, form in yeast  cells. Cofilin-bound cables would undergo net depolymerization in the presence of Aip1p, as occurs for purified actin filaments in vitro. Tropomyosin, which is localized to  actin cables (Liu and Bretscher, 1989), can compete for  cofilin binding sites on actin (Bernstein and Bamburg,  1982). Thus, tropomyosin would stabilize a subset of cables against Aip1p-cofilin depolymerization and these  would go on to be the normal cables visualized in cells. In  the aip1Delta strain or in a cofilin mutant that mislocalizes  Aip1p (cof1-19), Aip1p would not be able to function synergistically with cofilin to destabilize the filaments, and  both cofilin-bound and tropomyosin-bound populations of  filaments would be maintained. In support of this model,  cofilin also localizes to rare actin cables in act1-159 tpm1Delta  and act1-159 mdm20Delta double mutant strains (Belmont et  al., 1998), which would be predicted to have hyperstable  F-actin structures that would not be readily disassembled  by cofilin-Aip1p.</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42887</offset><text>The aip1Delta allele was also found to enhance the defects  observed in specific actin mutants (act1-119, act1-125, and  act1-133) and in null alleles of genes encoding several  components of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Sac6p,  Sla1p, and Cap2p).

A second hypothesis is  that high ratios of cofilin/actin are required for Aip1p  binding, but that at high concentrations of Aip1p, net depolymerization prevents cosedimentation of Aip1p with  actin. A model that is consistent with substoichiometric or  cofilin-dependent filament binding, net filament depolymerization, and the two-hybrid footprinting data is that  Aip1p enhances the weak severing activity of cofilin (MacIver et al. 1991; McGough et al., 1997).</text></passage><passage><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>44650</offset><text>Aip1p is the first protein aside from actin and LIM-kinase to show a physical interaction with cofilin.
