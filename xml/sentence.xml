sub-acute stroke.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>482</offset><text>A literature search was performed to identify randomized, controlled trials; studies with the same outcome measure were pooled by calculating the mean difference.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>645</offset><text>Separate quantitative analyses for high-intensity and low-intensity constraint-induced movement therapy were applied when possible.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>777</offset><text>Five randomized, controlled trials were included, comprising 106 participants.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>856</offset><text>The meta-analysis demonstrated significant mean differences in favor of constraint-induced movement therapy for the Fugl-Meyer arm,

high-intensity constraint-induced movement therapy.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>1515</offset><text>This meta-analysis demonstrates a trend toward positive effects of high-intensity and low-intensity constraint-induced movement therapy in acute or sub-acute stroke, but also suggests that low-intensity constraint-induced movement therapy may be more beneficial during this period than high-intensity constraint-induced movement therapy.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>1853</offset><text>However, these results were based on a small number of studies.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>1917</offset><text>Therefore, more trials are needed applying different doses of therapy early after stroke and a better understanding is needed about the different time windows in which underlying mechanisms of recovery operate.</text></sentence></passage></document><document><id>21488974</id><passage><infon

key="type">abstract</infon><offset>68</offset><sentence><offset>68</offset><text>There is now clear evidence from population-based and experimental animal studies that maternal obesity and maternal overnutrition, particularly excessive intake of high-fat and high-sugar diets, is associated with an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the offspring.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>350</offset><text>Whilst the physiological reasons for this association are still not fully understood, one of the key pathways appears to be the ability of exposure to an oversupply of energy, fat and sugar during critical windows of development to program an increased food intake in the offspring.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>633</offset><text>This review will focus on our current understanding of the programming of food intake, with a focus on the importance of the maternal diet.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>773</offset><text>Specifically, we will discuss how exposure to an increased energy supply before birth and in early infancy, and/or increased maternal intake of palatable foods alters the development of the systems regulating appetite and food preferences, and how these changes interact to promote excess consumption and thus predispose the offspring to weight gain and obesity.</text></sentence></passage></document><document><id>21571957</id><passage><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>0</offset><sentence><offset>0</offset><text>A comparison of

analyses use genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate causal effects of modifiable risk factors on disease outcomes.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>248</offset><text>Genetic variants typically explain a small proportion of the variability in risk factors; hence Mendelian randomisation analyses can require large sample

accurate as possible when measuring absolute dose to compare with calculated dose.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>273</offset><text>This limits the uncertainties associated with the dosimeter itself and allows the task of dose QA to focus on detecting errors in the treatment planning (TPS) and/or delivery systems.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>457</offset><text>This work introduces enhancements to the measurement accuracy of a 3D dosimeter comprised of a helical plane of diodes in a volumetric phantom.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>601</offset><text>METHODS: We describe the methods and derivations of new corrections that account for repetition rate dependence, intrinsic relative sensitivity per diode, field size dependence based on the dynamic field size determination, and positional correction.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>852</offset><text>Required and described is an accurate "virtual inclinometer" algorithm.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>924</offset><text>The system allows for calibrating the array directly against an ion chamber signal collected with high angular resolution.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>1047</offset><text>These enhancements are quantitatively validated using several strategies including ion chamber measurements taken using a "blank" plastic shell mimicking the actual phantom, and comparison to high resolution dose calculations for a variety of fields: static, simple arcs, and VMAT.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>1329</offset><text>A number of sophisticated treatment planning algorithms were benchmarked against ion chamber measurements for their ability to handle a

normalization, the average passing rates are reduced to 94.6 and 85.7% for the 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm criteria, respectively.</text></sentence><sentence><offset>2386</offset><text>Some algorithms in the convolution/superposition family are not sufficiently accurate in predicting the exit dose in the presence of a 15 cm diameter air
